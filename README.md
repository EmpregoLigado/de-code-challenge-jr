# Backend Engineer Code Challenge - Levee

Through this challenge, we want to know your development skills and especially how you solve problems.

## No time to take the challenge?

You can send a pull request link with your contribution to any Open Source project or any project of your own that you believe demonstrates your technical level and the quality of your code.
Remember that the more code we view, the better it will be for us to evaluate you. :)

## About the challenge

We have 2 data subsets:
1. **jobs.txt**: Contains the jobs openings separated by category (file "jobs.txt") 
2. **category.txt**: Contains the category name and code (file "category.txt")

See the structure below:

### Jobs:
| Partner ID | Job Title  | Category ID | Expires At | Open Position Amount
| ---        | ---        | ---         | ---        | :--:
| 1123       | Seller     | 3           | 1/21/2018  |  1

### Categories:
| Category ID | Title      | 
| ---         | :--:       |
| 1           | Technology | 

Based on this data, we want you to create a solution that shows the following calculations:
1. The number of Open Positions per Category Name;
2. The last three Jobs that have expired.

It is important to follow the instructions below:
- It would be great if you load this data to any Database Systems of your choice;
- It would be great if you use Python in some part of your solution;


Make sure:
- Your code should allow further executions. That is, when a new file arrives (with the same columns) the code must runs successfully;
- Your code should assure the quality of the data. 


## Prerequisites

Your test must have a README with the necessary steps to:

- Install the dependencies;
- Run the project;
- See the output data;

### Technology

Python. Scala can be an alternative.

### We like:

- Workload Management;
- Data Visualization Tools;
- Spark;
- Documentation;
- Docker;
- Structured commits;
- Tests;
- CI.

## What is being evaluated

Your ability to understand a problem, design a solution and apply it.
We want to see how you solve the proposed problem and your skills with the proposed technologies.

## Submission

To send us your code, you can:

- Fork this repository and send us a pull request.
- Give us access to your repository on github, bitbucket or gitlab. Add the user bonigauglitz.
